This guide walks you through understanding, installing, and using Swarm. It also explains how to contribute or ask for help. Swarm is in active development and it is untested in the wild, so use it at your own risk. To interact with Swarm, you will need to use the command line. If you are not comfortable using it, it might be worth to familiarise yourself `here <http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_lts0010.php>`_ first.

Censorship resistant storage and communication infrastructure for a sovereign digital society.

Objective
==========
Swarm augments existing Smart-Contract platform's (e.g. Ethereum) with incentivised permissionless storage- and communication protocols to operate decentrelised network-infrastructure to provide a full Web 3.0 base-layer for DAPP Developers.

Overview
========================

Swarm is a peer-to-peer network of nodes providing distributed digital services by contributing resources (storage, message forwarding, payment processing) to each other. These contributions are accurately accounted for on a peer to peer basis, allowing nodes to trade resource for resource, but offering monetary compensation to nodes consuming less than they serve.
