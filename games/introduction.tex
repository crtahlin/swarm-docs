%short(!) introduction to the idea of offchain processing. Emphasise scaling benefits and the fact the security is not compromised.

\textbf{What is a payment channel?}\\
A payment channel is a smart contract that allows users to send each other payments repeatedly without all those payments having to be broadcast to the network and inlcuded in the blockchain.

\textbf{Why do we want payment channels/}\\
The keywords are: Speed, Price, Scalability, Privacy.

Motivation\\

scalability\\
blockchain bloating and transactions proliferation\\
blockchain as judge as last resort\\
implications for privacy\\
desired features\\


\textbf{How are payment channels achieved?}\\
There are already some implementations in existence - from Lightening Network to Stochastic payments. Often these systems struggle with technical limitations of bitcoin - we believe that we can do better on ethereum and in this paper we hope lay out the theoretical foundations.

Existing solutions\\

Lightening network\\
Raiden\\
Interledger
