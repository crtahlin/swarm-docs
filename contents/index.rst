Swarm is a censorship resistant, permissionles, decentrelized storage- and communication infrastructure. 

This base-layer infrastructure provides these services by contributing resources to each other. These contributions are accurately accounted for on a peer to peer basis, allowing nodes to trade resource for resource, but offering monetary compensation to nodes consuming less than they serve.
Swarm is using existing Smart-Contract platforms (e.g. Ethereum) to implement the financial incentivisation.
