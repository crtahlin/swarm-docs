Swarm - storage and communication infrastructure for a sovereign digital society.

Objective
==========
Swarm augments existing Smart-Contract platforms (e.g. Ethereum) with incentivised, censorship resistant, permissionless storage- and communication protocols to operate decentrelised network-infrastructure to provide a full Web 3.0 base-layer for DAPP Developers.

Overview
========================

Swarm is a peer-to-peer network of nodes providing distributed digital services by contributing resources (storage, message forwarding, payment processing) to each other. These contributions are accurately accounted for on a peer to peer basis, allowing nodes to trade resource for resource, but offering monetary compensation to nodes consuming less than they serve.
