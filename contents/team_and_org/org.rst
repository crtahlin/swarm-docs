Organisation and Funding
=======================

The Swarm project has no coin and has not done any form of crowed-sale. 
Funding between 2014 and 2019 was mainly provided by the Ethereum Foundation and augmented by private Sponsors.
The project is financed by parties which require Swarm as an infrastructure.

The following organisations employ employees or pay contractors to work on Swarm: 
 - `Ethereum Foundation <https://www.ethereum.org/>`_ Ethereum is the main sponsor for the Swarm project. The Ethereum Foundation employs the majority of the team.

 - `IOV Labs <https://iovlabs.org/>`_ Contributes with substaintial resources since the IOV and Swarm Partnership in June 2019.

 - Private Sponsors - Swarm is partially supported through private investors. e.g. E-Point (Budapest).
